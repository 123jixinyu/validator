Contributing

There will be a development brach for each version of this package i.e. v1-development, please
make your pull requests against this branch.

If changes are breaking please create an issue, I'll create a new version that you can make a pull
request against, and then review from there.

I strongly encourage everyone whom creates a custom validation function to contribute them and
help make this package even better.
